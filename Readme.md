# Vysor.IO_Bot

#### Intro

Some days ago I was reading about an app called Vysor 

- an [Article on TC](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/24/vysor-puts-your-android-devices-screen-on-your-desktop/)
- the [app page](www.vysor.io)

This app allows you to control your android device from your desktop pc installing a daemon on your phone and a chrome app/extension.  
I was interested on how the app worked and the security aspect of having something like this on your phone...   
I wrote this hack to explain how you can simply create a simple bot using vysor.

#### Installation
In order to test the script:
- vysor.io it is installed and working on your machine
- you neeed nodejs installed and configured on your system
- download the script
- inside the script directory digits: node install ws

To run the script: node coc.js

#### coc.js
To use this script you need Clash of Clans game installed.  
This script launch clash of clans and simulate swype on the screen: it is useful when you have no shield.  
This basically helps you to protect the village when the shield is 0, basically simulating activity.
